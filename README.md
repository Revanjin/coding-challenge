## Tasks:

### 1. An overview of every person in the Star Wars Universe ✅

_my own notes:_

- The Api does not offer a full list of all characters, **pagination was not required** ✅

### 2. A Person is being displayed in a Tile. Output: ✅

- Name ✅
- Hair Color ✅
- Eye Color ✅
- Gender ✅
- Homeworld ✅
  _my own notes:_
- display gender with font awesome ✅

### 3. The overview of every person can be filtered by movies ✅
  _my own notes:_
- click on filter should close the filter list ✅

### 4. The overview must consider responsiveness ✅

### 5. A Homeworld in a Card should link onto a detail page with several information about the planet ✅

_my own notes:_
- Display a planet in the back? ✅
- Maybe something interactive? ✅

### 6. Back button :) (back to an unfiltered list) ✅

_my own notes:_
- should take a month. _inside joke_
